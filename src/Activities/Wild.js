    <h1>Overview</h1>
<p>Wild Wadi Water Park is located in Dubai, in front of the iconic Burj Al Arab. With its Arabian folklore theme centered around the character Juha, Wild Wadi offers nearly 30 rides and attractions suitable for the whole family.</p>

<h1>Wild Wadi Rides</h1>
<p>Wild Wadi Water Park provides a wide selection of rides to cater to all ages and sizes. Guests can enjoy the exhilarating Flood River with its meter-high waves, or relax on Juha's Journey, a long and lazy river. The park also offers various activities for kids, including racing slides and water guns.</p>
<p>Thrill-seekers can experience the adrenaline-fueled rides at Wild Wadi, such as Tantrum Alley and Burj Surj. For those who love surfing, the Wipeout and Riptide Flowriders provide the ultimate surfing experience. The Wipeout Flowrider, designed by Thomas Lochtefeld, shoots out over seven tonnes of water per second, creating a realistic wave effect for body-boarding and knee-boarding.</p>
<p>Please note that some rides are not suitable for guests with disabilities, pregnant guests, or those with heart or back conditions. Information boards at the entrance of each ride provide ride rules and restrictions based on their nature.</p>
